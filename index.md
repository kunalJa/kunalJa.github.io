# Portfolio/Blog

I am a student at the [University of Texas at Austin](http://utexas.edu) studying Electrical and Computer Engineering and Math.

In the _Posts_ section, you will find posts that can be organized by tags, clicking on one of the tags will allow you to see many other posts of the same tag.
The posts range in topic from my thoughts on books and papers to descriptions of projects and other things I am learning.

In the _Projects_ section, you will find links to projects- most of which will be on [github](http://github.com/kunalJa).
